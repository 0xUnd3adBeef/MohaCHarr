# MohaCHarr

> c'est completement harr.

I'm Moha (short for Mohammad), a 15 y/o cyber enjoyer who got bored of video games and decided breaking stuff was more fun. Currently grinding through HTB Academy's CPTS cert and planning to hit OSCP after that. Got the eJPT, wrecked Dante Pro Lab, and even finished the Google Cybersecurity Coursera thing because… why not.

still jobless atm 🥀🥀💔💔

## What I Do

- Mess around with Python until something works (or doesn’t)
- Learn how to break systems so I can *ethically* break more systems
- Reverse engineer random stuff just to see if I can
- Occasionally write decent scripts, mostly for fun

## Selected Projects

### chinese-drone-hacking
Reverse engineering a cheap generic drone. Sniffed comms, still trying to reverse the app.
Check it out @ : https://github.com/AdnaneCybR/chinese-drone-hacking

### PhantomNode (Private)
A Discord RAT I made in ✨Python✨ for ✨educational purposes✨. Fully modular, handles system info, shell commands, file transfers, persistence, even RDP setup — and it’s still undetected, somehow. Honestly trash but it works, and that's what matters.

### SecNotes
A raw dump of my notes from TryHackMe, HTB, random docs, and cursed StackOverflow threads. Use at your own risk (or benefit). Updated when I remember.

## Training & Achievements

- 🎯 **HTB Academy**  
  - Top 5% | 282 targets compromised  
  - Completed 30+ modules across web, network, and privilege escalation  
  - Modules include:  
    - Windows & Linux Privilege Escalation  
    - SQLi, Command Injection, File Uploads  
    - AD Attacks, Pivoting & Tunneling, Metasploit, Ffuf, SQLMap  
    - ...and everything in between

- 🧠 **Certs**  
  - eJPT (INE)  
  - Google Cybersecurity Certificate
  - Not a cert but I pwned the Dante ProLab
 
- 🎯 **Goals**
  - Currently working on CPTS by HTB  
  - OSCP as soon as possible

## Tech I Use (and break)

- Python, Bash, JavaScript  
- Currently learning C and C++ to go deeper into exploit dev  
- Tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark  
- Mostly on Kali Linux, sometimes Parrot, and yeah... Windows too

## Final Words

This account's the clean one — check out [@AdnaneCybR](https://github.com/AdnaneCybR) for the messy bits. Some projects are private for obvious reasons.

> everything here is just for educational purposes. don't be weird with it.

still jobless btw, hmu if you're hiring pentesters with no experience but too much time.
