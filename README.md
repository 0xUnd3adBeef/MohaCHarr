# MohaCHarr

> c'est harr.

I'm Moha (short for Mohammad), a 15 y/o cyber enjoyer who got bored of video games and decided breaking stuff was more fun. Currently grinding through HTB Academy's CPTS cert and planning to hit OSCP after that. Got the eJPT, wrecked Dante Pro Lab, and even finished the Google Cybersecurity Coursera thing because… why not.

still jobless atm 🥀🥀💔💔

## What I Do

- Mess around with Python until something works (or doesn’t)
- Learn how to break systems so I can *ethically* break more systems
- Reverse engineer random stuff just to see if I can
- Occasionally write decent scripts, mostly for fun or chaos

## Selected Projects

### chinese-drone-hacking
Reverse engineering a cheap generic drone. Sniffed comms, poked at firmware, generally just annoyed the thing until it talked back. A nice intro into hardware hacking and RF fun.
Check it out @ : https://github.com/AdnaneCybR/chinese-drone-hacking

### PhantomNode (Private)
A Discord RAT I made in Python for ✨educational purposes✨. Fully modular, handles system info, shell commands, file transfers, persistence, even RDP setup — and it’s still undetected, somehow. Honestly trash but it works, and that's what matters.

### SecNotes
A raw dump of my notes from TryHackMe, HTB, random docs, and cursed StackOverflow threads. Use at your own risk (or benefit). Updated when I remember.

    - AD Attacks, Pivoting & Tunneling, Metasploit, Ffuf, SQLMap  
    - ...and everything in between

- 🧠 **Certs**  
  - eJPT (INE / OffSec)

  - OSCP on the horizon (I’ll get there)

## Tech I Use (and break)

- Python, Bash, JavaScript  
- Currently learning C and C++ to go deeper into exploit dev  
- Tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark  
- Mostly on Kali Linux, sometimes Parrot, and yeah... Windows too

## Final Words

This account's the clean one — check out [@AdnaneCybR](https://github.com/AdnaneCybR) for the messy bits. Some projects are private for obvious reasons.

still jobless btw, hmu if you're hiring pentesters with no experience but too much time.
